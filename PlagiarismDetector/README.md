The Plagiarism Team is pursuing several different approaches to the project.  

In the Plagiarism Detector class, there will be several classes and sub-classes to pull different segments of the file and compare their similarity
Thos pieces are: 
1. String syntax - Is it the same set of strings
2. Variable names - Did they use the same variables and info
3. ByteCode - Did it compile to the same code
4. Function use - Did they just change loop parameters or type
5. Pattern of Student - If we were to check previous documents, did their habbits match up?

An implementation of the LCS Algorithm, or longest common string, is being implemented to also evaluate whether or not they copied large chunks of code from another source
Using this method, the general similarity of the file can be viewed.
