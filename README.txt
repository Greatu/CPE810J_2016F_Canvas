In week 2, we try to complete the methods in the abstract class Code.

The compile() method, compile and run the java program and display the output to the console. We will try to run other kind of programs (like C++ and Python) later.

The display() method, output the source code to the console.

The setGrade() and setComments() method, set the grade and comments for the particular code object. The comment is now in String format, we will try to complete it in several lines later.

The update() method is to generate two files: one is comments.txt and another is grade.txt. Please remind the grade.txt is in String format.

We are trying to solve the problem of getting the path of the source code file with the unzip team...
