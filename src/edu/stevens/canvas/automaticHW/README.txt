In this week, we try to complete the methods in the abstract class Code.

The display() method, output the source code.

The setGrade() and setComment() method, set the grade and comments for the particular code object.
    the comment is in String format, we will try to complete it in several lines later.

The update() method is to generate two files: one is comments.txt and another is grade.txt. Please remind the grade.txt is in String format.

We are tring to solve the compile() method...
