The Plagiarism Team is pursuing several different approaches to the project.  

The byte code that is created by compiling code takes care of the process of understanding the functional differences between code.  With smart compilers, the difference between small changes will automatically be taken care of.
Another approach was to look at the syntax and styling of the words.  This was done by removing Java keywords and necessary formatting so that the forced format of Java was minimized, and all that was left was almost all user created.

In order to test each of these methods, the Longest Common Sequence algorithms was employed.  The LCS algorithm can identify the longest common string sequences between two large sets of strings.  
Since byte code is going to be similar, the LCS algorithm can to determine how similar it is.
In terms of user syntax, the LCS algorithm is a good choice to match how much a user took from others barring small details and differences.
